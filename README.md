# Comet - CSS3 Reset for Modern Websites

### Description
Comet is a minimalist and comprehensive CSS3 reset designed to provide a clean, consistent foundation for building modern websites. By normalizing styles across different browsers, it ensures a reliable starting point, eliminating browser-specific inconsistencies. This reset focuses on enhancing accessibility, responsiveness, and typography while maintaining a lightweight footprint.

### Key Features:
Universal Reset: The `*` selector applies a universal box-sizing rule of `border-box` and resets margin and padding, ensuring predictable layout behavior.

Typography Consistency: The `html` and `body` styles establish a consistent line-height and font-family stack, optimizing legibility and uniformity across platforms.

Semantic Element Styling: Elements such as `main`, `h1`, and `pre` are reset for default presentation, ensuring semantic HTML tags maintain their intended meaning while looking visually uniform.

Interactive Elements: The reset applies standardized button, input, and select styles, ensuring consistent styling of form elements across browsers and removing unnecessary focus ring quirks in Firefox.

Improved Accessibility: Form controls like checkboxes, radio buttons, and search inputs are normalized for better usability, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Flexible Layout: The `details`, `summary`, and other HTML5 elements are reset to block or list-item display properties, making them easier to work with in modern layouts.

Image Handling: The `img` tag is cleared of borders, ensuring it doesn't carry over any unintended styles, which is especially important for responsive design.

Cross-browser Support: Special focus on WebKit-based browsers, with tweaks like removing inner spin buttons for number inputs and search decoration styling.

### Supported Browsers & Versions

Comet is best suited for modern browsers that support CSS3 and WebKit properties. It fully supports browsers like the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. However, Internet Explorer and older versions of Safari and Chrome may face issues, especially with form element resets and WebKit-specific properties. The reset is optimized for use on browsers from 2015 onward, with a strong focus on current, widely-used browser versions.
